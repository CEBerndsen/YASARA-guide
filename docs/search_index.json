I wrote this for students in my class, however it developed into a guide for those who wanted to explore structures using freely available resources. 1.0.2 What is in this guide? This guide contains 3 main parts: 1. Guide to YASARA functions for users 2. Analysis and Illustration of molecular structure using YASARA 3. Incorporating YASARA into an educational setting 1.0.3 A note on using the command line GUIs are great, however it is worth knowing how to use the command line to increase speed and control. Yes, it is not as easy, especially for new users, but restricting your use to activities that are easy is a limited existence. I will always describe both ways of doing things in YASARA by menu list: Menu1&gt;menu2&gt;menu3&gt;choice and code chunk with comments: # This is a comment in code &gt; This is code that can be executed For R, it will be via code chunks and for Excel via menus. Other programs will be described as appropriate with images. 1.0.4 End of section checks and active reading I encourage you to actively read this book. Try to follow along descriptions in the program and recreate my results. Most sections in Parts 1 and 2 will end with a few tasks to complete to ensure that the reader understands the material. This is not required or graded, just an aid in learning to use the program. Answers are provided in the answers chapter along with explanations. 1.0.5 Questions and corrections I make mistakes. If you find an error or something does not make sense let me know via the GitHub page for this book. You can also maka pull request for corrections or helpful additions. 1.1 Acknowledgements 1.1.1 Who owns YASARA and the other programs in this book I have no claims to YASARA or any of the other programs described in this guide. Citations and links are provided where appropriate to give authors credit where due. I receive no compensation from any of the developers; I just enjoy using their software. I have written macros and R scripts that are referenced in this guide and I have made those freely available here under an MIT License. "],
["obtaining-yasara.html", "Chapter 2 Obtaining YASARA", " Chapter 2 Obtaining YASARA 2.0.1 What is YASARA YASARA stands for Yet Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application and allows interactive viewing, manipulation, and analysis of molecular data and models. The simplest version of YASARA, YASARAview, is freely available via the internet at: http://www.yasara.org/viewdl.htm For a fee, more capable versions of YASARA are available. However, the majority of this book will deal with the functions in free version of YASARA, YASARAview. 2.0.2 Download YASARAview Visit the YASARAview website and enter the appropriate information into the menu. If you are unsure about 32-bit or 64-bit, in Windows this information is shown by clicking on This PC in the Windows Explorer then System Properties. System Type will indicate 32-bit or 64-bit as shown in 2.1 . Figure 2.1: The steps to find operating system for a Windows user Once you have submitted the information, you will receive an email which will let you download the YASARA program. 2.0.3 Installing YASARA Move the YASARA program (Mac) or install package (Windows) to an appropriate folder. I have found that installing and running YASARA from the Downloads folder is not a good idea. On Macs, it seems that programs in the Downloads folder are not given read/write permission which can cause issues with running YASARA. "]
