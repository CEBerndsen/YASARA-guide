I wrote this for students in my class, however it developed into a guide for those who wanted to explore structures using freely available resources. 1.2 What is in this guide? This guide contains 3 main parts: 1. Guide to YASARA functions for users 2. Analysis and Illustration of molecular structure using YASARA 3. Incorporating YASARA into an educational setting 1.3 A note on using the command line GUIs are great, however it is worth knowing how to use the command line to increase speed and control. Yes, it is not as easy, especially for new users, but restricting your use to activities that are easy is a limited existence. I will always describe both ways of doing things in YASARA by menu list: Menu1&gt;menu2&gt;menu3&gt;choice and code chunk with comments: # This is a comment in code &gt; This is code that can be executed For R, it will be via code chunks and for Excel via menus. Other programs will be described as appropriate with images. 1.4 End of section checks and active reading I encourage you to actively read this book. Try to follow along descriptions in the program and recreate my results. Most sections in Parts 1 and 2 will end with a few tasks to complete to ensure that the reader understands the material. This is not required or graded, just an aid in learning to use the program. Answers are provided in the answers chapter along with explanations. 1.5 Questions and corrections I make mistakes. If you find an error or something does not make sense let me know via the GitHub page for this book. You can also maka pull request for corrections or helpful additions. 1.6 Acknowledgements 1.6.1 Who owns YASARA and the other programs in this book I have no claims to YASARA or any of the other programs described in this guide. Citations and links are provided where appropriate to give authors credit where due. I receive no compensation from any of the developers; I just enjoy using their software. I have written macros and R scripts that are referenced in this guide and I have made those freely available here under an MIT License. "],
["obtaining-yasara.html", "Chapter 2 Obtaining YASARA 2.1 What is YASARA 2.2 Download YASARAview 2.3 Installing YASARA", " Chapter 2 Obtaining YASARA 2.1 What is YASARA YASARA stands for Yet Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application and allows interactive viewing, manipulation, and analysis of molecular data and models. The simplest version of YASARA, YASARAview, is freely available via the internet at: http://www.yasara.org/viewdl.htm For a fee, more capable versions of YASARA are available. However, the majority of this book will deal with the functions in free version of YASARA, YASARAview. 2.2 Download YASARAview Visit the YASARAview website and enter the appropriate information into the menu. If you are unsure about 32-bit or 64-bit, in Windows this information is shown by clicking on This PC in the Windows Explorer then System Properties. System Type will indicate 32-bit or 64-bit as shown in 2.1 . Figure 2.1: The steps to find operating system for a Windows user Once you have submitted the information, you will receive an email which will let you download the YASARA program. 2.3 Installing YASARA Move the YASARA program (Mac) or install package (Windows) to an appropriate folder. I have found that installing and running YASARA from the Downloads folder is not a good idea. On Macs, it seems that programs in the Downloads folder are not given read/write permission which can cause issues with running YASARA. "],
["the-yasara-user-interface.html", "Chapter 3 The YASARA user interface 3.1 Heads Up Display (HUD) 3.2 The Console 3.3 Menu System 3.4 Where to find help 3.5 File system 3.6 Knowledge Self-Checks", " Chapter 3 The YASARA user interface Open YASARA and you should see a screen that looks similar to 3.1. Figure 3.1: The initial YASARA screen When a file is loaded it will appear in the center of the display in one of the various visualiation styles to be covered in a section 5.2. So far we have not learned to load a molecule or to select anything, so do not panic! This chapter is one to read to start and then read again after you have read through Chapters 4 to 7. The next sections will orient you to the Heads-up Display (3.1), the command line console 3.2, the top Menu 3.3, and the file organization (3.5), and includes a section on where to find help (3.4). 3.1 Heads Up Display (HUD) The Heads-up Display or HUD in YASARAview consists of two main pieces: the Atom Properties list and the Scene Content 3.2. Figure 3.2: Heads-Up Display in YASARA. The Atom properties area is shown inside the yellow box, while the Scene Content table is shown in the red box 3.1.1 Atom Properties The Atom Properties list describes the characteristics of a selected atom. These characteristics include the identifying traits such as element, what residue:Mol:Object it is a part of, and where it is located. Further characteristics place it within the context of the molecule being displayed under the section Bonds. Finally, there is a section containing 3 items: Marked Distance, Marked Angle, and Marked Dihedral. These are types of measurements we will use in Chapter ??. 3.1.2 Scene Content The Scene Content table shows what models1 are loaded into the system. There are 5 columns in this table: Obj, Name, Vis, Act, and Atom. Obj: Numerical assignment of the Obj. This is a useful indentifier for commands to maniupulate the Obj. Name: Indicates the name of the model. Typically this is the PDB ID, however you can rename the Object. Vis: Stands for “Visible”. When a file is loaded, this will default “Yes”. Left-clicking with the mouse on “Yes”, will change it to “No” and the model will disappear2. Act: Stands for “Active”. When a file is loaded, this will default to “Yes”. A file that is active can be manipulated and is included in the view screen if Vis is set to “Yes. To change this to”No&quot; the Object must be removed from the screen ??. Atom: This column shows the number of the first atom in the Object. Like Obj this number can be useful for manipulating the view and other commands. 3.1.3 Hiding the HUD The HUD can be hid or revealed by pressing the “Insert” key. This will be important when taking screenshots or making figures as covered in Chapter ??. 3.2 The Console You can manipulate the view and perform analysis of the molecules in YASARA through two methods: the Console and the Menu system (3.3). The console can be accessed by pressing the Space Bar. The console will appear at the bottom of the program window as shown in Figure 3.3. Pressing the Space Bar a second time will result in a larger console window. To hide the console, click your mouse in the program window somewhere outside of the console area. Figure 3.3: The console in YASARA, just another name for the command line. Left panel shows the small console window and the right panel shows the large console window Commands are typed directly into the console in the YASARA command system or Python. You can also copy and paste into the console using the Ctrl+C followed by Ctrl+V keys. Additionally you can copy console text by hightlighting and pressing Ctrl+C. The latter activity will be a useful tool when we get to the chapter on Making Movies (??). 3.2.1 Up Arrow! If you want to repeat or edit a command that you have already executed, whether in the console or using the interactive GUI or the menus, pressing Space Bar followed by the Up Arrow copies the previous command and allows you to repeat or edit the command to tweak the outcome. In YASARAview this is limited to the previous ten commands so if you know you are going to use a complex command again, copy it out before it is lost! 3.2.2 Tangent on using the command line and the interactive menus Users who are new to YASARA are often hesitant to use the console to perform tasks. For my students, they report this is due to inexperience with non-GUI interfaces and a fear of not knowing what to do. I get it. It took me nearly 3 years of using YASARA before I became comfortable opening the console regularly and even today, I still have issues to get the command line to work every time and to find the correct commands. BUT knowing how the program makes changes to the contents of the window is valuable for understanding what happened if it is not readily apparent and if you need help, having a sense of the command that is causing problems will make finding aid easier. As you become more experienced, you might begin to find command line is more versatile and even faster (assuming you type efficiently). For beginners, start by using the menus and checking the console for the command. Then start using the console to refine choices after using the menus to make the command. Finally, as you feel confident do as much as you can using the console. Given the importance of computers to many scientific careers, experience working with command line will only make you more marketable and flexible in many situations. 3.3 Menu System In addition to the console, YASARA can be controlled using the Menu System which has three parts: the Top Menu, the Top Row Buttons, and the Pop-up Menus. 3.3.1 Top Menu The Top Menu will look familiar to users who use the Microsoft suite of programs or most modern productivity software. The 8 top-level categories are shown in the green box in Figure 3.4. We will explore several of this categories in more depth in later chapters. One note to make now is that the Analyze category is inaccessible until a molecule is loaded. This is shown as being in light grey, compared to the black of other categories. In general, if a menu category or option cannot be used under the current conditions, it will be colored grey. Figure 3.4: Menu Bar of YASARA showing the Top Menu inside the green box and the Top row buttons inside the light blue box 3.3.2 Top row buttons The Top row buttons are quick ways to perform tasks such as center the view or open a new scene. The buttons are indicated by the light blue box in Figure 3.4. The buttons will vary depending what version of YASARA being used however there are a few common and useful ones, which are highlighted below. : This button allows you to select parts of a model in a box : This button allows you to select parts of a model in an arbitrary area which is somewhat circular. This is similar to the lasso tool seen in other programs. : This button clears everything out of the YASARA window. Typically you will get a warning to avoid inadvertant loss of data. : This button centers the active models in the window. This really useful early on until you gain experience orienting molecules. : This button rotates all the active models in the window. This button is often a source of frustrating for you when things start rotating unexpectedly. 3.3.3 Pop-up menu Figure 3.5: Example of the pop-up menu in YASARA In addition to the visible command options and readouts of YASARA like the Top Menu (3.3) and the HUD (3.1), there are ways to access commands on a selection. Referred to here as the pop-up menu (??), this menu can be accessed after a selection has been made by clicking on the selection using the right mouse button. Many of the options in the pop-up menu are found with some digging through the top menu, so this pop-up menu is a fast, easy way to find some of the most used commands. The pop-up menu is only accessible with a model loaded into YASARA. 3.4 Where to find help HELP!!!! This is probably the most requested piece of information. The reason for putting this underneath all the orientation is to make getting help easier. YASARA has a specific set of words and phrases. Knowing the “jargon” of YASARA makes limiting the amount of information during a help request easier. 3.4.1 SearchDoc The SearchDoc function can be found two ways: Help&gt;Search User Manual3 OR Press the Space Bar to open the console and type SearchDoc followed by the inquiry word or command. See code chunk below for examples. # Search for every help page containing the word color &gt;SearchDoc color # Search for every help page referencing the word PDB &gt;SearchDoc PDB The help page will open as a webpage in your default web browser (3.6). This page will list every time that word or phrase appears in the YASARA documentation. Figure 3.6: Results of using SearchDoc part 1: Initial search results Clicking on any of the blue links will take you to the page for the command as shown in 3.7. These pages have 3 parts: The box showing information on the command A brief text description of the command and purpose Examples of how to use the command in the console or in a macro. Figure 3.7: Results of using SearchDoc part 2: The help page for the ColorBG command Like this reference, the Menu row in the box describes where in the Menus this command is found. This is most useful early on and as you learn more about YASARA, the examples become useful too. Often you can compare what happened in your console to the examples to make sure that you are looking at the right command and using the correct arguments. 3.4.2 Help Movies While not formally part of the help system, users can click on the Help category in the top menu and then choose Play Help Movie (Help&gt;Play Help Movie) to access YASARA rendered movies introducing users to a variety of topics. The movies are interactive and useful for first-time users, however they are not searchable and can take a while to find a specific topic. Therefore, I recommend going through the help movies once or twice early on, but using SearchDoc as you become more experienced. 3.5 File system Figure 3.8: File folders created upon installing YASARA in Windows Upon installing windows, YASARA creates a series of folders similar to that shown in 3.8. The number and types of folders will depend on your YASARA version, however there will be several constant folders. Unless you have another data management system, I recommend using the YASARA system to start out. When you save a file, it will go into a folder corresponding to that file type, which can save a number of beginner headaches. 3.5.1 Naming files and Data Management While not specific to YASARA, having a good system to name and keep track of files that you create can save you many future issues. File names should be readable not only by a human but also the computer, especially if you are making a movie or executing a macro which iterates over a series of files. Therefore, some useful hints: Use a single string when naming a file – 01_model_ubiquitin.pdb or 01_ModelUbiquitin.pdb not this is a file with ubiquitin.pdb You can read spaces, but they can do funny things in a program. Avoid punctuation in file names – the only punctuation should be between the name and the file type 01_model_ubiquitin.pdb not 1:model/ubiquitin{today}.pdb Exceptions to this rule can be underscores (_) or dashes (-). Dates or numbers can help organize your progress – 01_model_ubiquitin.pdb or 2018-08-01_model_ubiquitin.pdb If you use numbers make sure you use two digits even for numbers less than 10. It helps keep files in order in the file viewer. Dates can be in any format but YYYY-MM-DD is most common internationally. Keep a key or notebook – This is will help you remember what you did along the way, but also help others who may work with or after you on the project. If you are using Open Science Framework (OSF) or Github to help with your project management, then the Wiki in OSF or the Readme in GitHub are great places to provide some insight into what your files are. Never be afraid to start over – Sometimes you will dig a hole in your work and not be able to get out. It is okay to start over and try again. Data management takes a while to become routine, but should be a skill that you exercise often. 3.6 Knowledge Self-Checks Answers to questions are found in the Answers chapter under the Chapter Three header (6.1) What action brings up the console in the YASARA window? What console command allows you to swap a residue? Where would you find the distance between to atoms? How can you bring up the previous command in the console? What is potentially problematic about each of the following file names? ubiquitin.pdb first model of a protein!.pdb 1_model_ubiquitin.pdb When I say Model I am referring to a file that is loaded in YASARA that displays as a molecule.

["file-types-and-how-to-work-with-them-in-yasara.html", "Chapter 4 File types and how to work with them in YASARA 4.1 Common model file types 4.2 Starting to work with models in YASARA 4.3 Loading a model 4.4 What does Obj vs. Mol vs. Res vs. Atom mean? 4.5 Saving Models 4.6 Knowledge Self-Checks4", " Chapter 4 File types and how to work with them in YASARA 4.1 Common model file types YASARA loads numerous types of files, however we will limit our discussion to just three: .pdb, .yob, and .sce. These file types are the most capable and easiest to export to other programs. Information on the other file types that YASARA can work with can be found using the SearchDoc command. 4.1.1 .pdb files .pdb formatted files are the gold standard for recording the three dimensional structures of biomolecules. Most visualization programs take .pdb files and many structural analysis methods start with a .pdb file or data generated from a .pdb file. Moreover, the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics or RCSB or Protein Databank stores the structural information on the &gt;100,000 biomolecules in the database in .pdb format. Therefore, the first files you should know how to use are .pdb files. A .pdb file consists of a few parts shown in Figure 4.1. A .pdb file can be viewed in a plain text editor such as TextEdit or NotePad and reveals that it consists largely of the atom identifiers, the coordinates for each atom in the molecule, the temperature or B-factor and the header. Figure 4.1: The PDB file format .pdb files are easy to move across several programs but are limited in that they contain only location information and the reliability of those locations. Any manipulations that are performed to color or stylize the molecule are not included. 4.1.2 .yob files (YASARA object) Like .pdb files, .yob files contain the 3-D coordinates for each atom, but also contain style information. If a color for a particular residue is set to red, it will be red in the saved .yob file as well. This file format is useful for annotating molecules and keep these annotations to pick up again later (keep a notebook to help remember what it all means though!). A .yob file can only contain one Object from the Scene Content table however. If you want multiple Objects or to save everything you need a Scene file. 4.1.3 .sce files (Scene files) .sce files are the most sophisticated file type in YASARA. A scene file can contain 3-D data and stylization on multiple objects. This can also include any labels (??), colors (5.3), and other manipulations you may perform. With more content, comes a need to be careful to keep track of the information effectively. So use .sce files for key models or findings and use .yob or .pdb files for intermediate steps. 4.2 Starting to work with models in YASARA So far, I have shown you what YASARA can tell you and how to find information but we have not yet worked with any models. From this section forward we will be fully immersed in using YASARA. I encourage you to follow along and try to recreate each step that I do. Then test your understanding with the end of chapter exercises. 4.3 Loading a model Model files can be loaded into YASARA from the local hardrive or retrieved from the RCSB server. 4.3.1 .pdb files Files stored on the hard drive can be loaded by: File &gt; Load &gt; PDB file, then navigate to the file location. OR # Specify LoadPDB, then put the name of the file. This assumes the file is in the pdb folder within the YASARA file tree or in the working directory &gt;LoadPDB &lt;&lt;PDB:ID&gt;&gt; # Example that should work as 1crn is provided with the YASARA software &gt;LoadPDB 1crn OR Drag the file into an empty YASARA window 4.3.2 Getting a .pdb file from the internet Files stored on the hard drive can be loaded by: File &gt; Load &gt; PDB file from Internet, then provide the PDB ID (ex. 1UBQ) in the dialog box that appears. OR # Specify LoadPDB, then put the name of the file. This assumes the file is in the pdb folder within the YASARA file tree or in the working directory &gt;LoadPDB &lt;&lt;PDB:ID&gt;&gt;, download=yes # Example that should work as 1crn is provided with the YASARA software &gt;LoadPDB 1crn, download=yes Note that the only difference in the commands is adding download = yes. Also realize that you can download the files directly from the RCSB via the linked form or from the individual page for the model using the download button. 4.3.3 .yob files Files stored on the hard drive can be loaded by: File &gt; Load &gt; YASARA Object, then navigate to the file location. OR # Specify LoadYOb, then put the name of the file. This assumes the file is in the yob folder within the YASARA file tree or in the working directory &gt;LoadYOb filepath/file.yob # Example that should work as dopc is provided with the YASARA software &gt;LoadYOb yob/dopc OR Drag the file into an empty YASARA window 4.3.4 .sce files Loading a scene file will replace and delete anything else that was in the window beforehand. You can add .pdb or .yob files to Scene files, but you cannot add a Scene file to a .pdb or .yob. Files stored on the hard drive can be loaded by: File &gt; Load &gt; YASARA Scene, then navigate to the file location. OR # Specify LoadPDB, then put the name of the file. This assumes the file is in the yob folder within the YASARA file tree or in the working directory &gt;LoadSceb filepath\\file.sce # Example that should work as dhfr_water.sce is provided with the YASARA software &gt;LoadSce sce\\dhfr_water.sce,Settings=No OR Drag the file into an empty YASARA window 4.4 What does Obj vs. Mol vs. Res vs. Atom mean? YASARA organizes models at several levels, which permits easier control of manipulations to the model. In the simplest sense, an Object consists of one or more Mol (Molecules) which consists of one or more Res (Residues) which consist of one or more Atoms. Let’s unpack each level in a bit more detail before showing how this might be useful. Obj (Objects) – Objs are the highest level of organization. An object is a complete model composed of one or more molecules. Objects can be split into several objects. Objects are typically numbered. Mol (Molecule) – A Mol is the second level of organization and typically refers to a single contiguous chain within the scene. A Mol can be as simple as a single atom or a single amino acid or be larger and composed of several atoms or amino acids. Mol are defined in the .pdb or .yob file and can be broken into smaller pieces. Molecules are typically called “A” or “B” or another alphabetical name Res (Residue) – A residue refers to a subunit of a Molecule. This name comes from classical biochemistry and an refer to a single saccharide within a longer chain, a single amino acid within a protein, or a single nucleotide within a nucleic acid. Residues are composed of one or more Atoms and typically are not split. For most structural biochemistry, we think about residues and their function within the larger molecule. Residues are typically referred to by the three letter amino acid, nucleic acid, or carbohydrate name. Search the RCSB Ligand database if you do not recognize the abbreviation. Atom – Atoms are the smallest unit within YASARA and describe single atoms. Atoms are not split in YASARA (no fission!). Atoms are referred to by their IUPAC names but can also be referred to in organic chemistry nomenclature (e.g. C or N ). 4.4.1 Why is the organization important? Like the English language where sentences contain nouns and verbs, which define the action and who/what was involved, YASARA requires an action to perform and what to act on. The examples below in code chunk below give a few examples of how these commands work. # Load a molecule into the window so that we can see the effects of each command &gt;LoadPDB 1crn # Command examples to try # Color all alanine residues red &gt;ColorRes ala, red # Color Obj 1 blue &gt;ColorObj 1, blue # Rotate Obj 1 around the y axis 1 degree &gt;RotateObj 1, Y = 30 # Count all the amino acids in Obj 1 &gt;CountRes Obj 1 # the result of the count will appear on the same line as the command # Show all the Hydrogen bonds in Molecule A &gt;ShowHBoMol A The general YASARA syntax or grammar for commands, is ActionLevel and then the specifics of the molecule or part of the molecule to affect. Most commands can be used at any level so: # Same action different levels &gt;ColorObj 1, red &gt;ColorMol A, red &gt;ColorRes 1, red &gt;ColorAtom 1, red Effectively there are 4 nouns and lots of verbs. So if you can remember the levels of organization and the basic verbs, you can manipulate and analyze most any model. 4.5 Saving Models Once you have your model or scene in a form that is useful, you can also export the data. This is the one action I typically prefer to use the GUI over the command line, however I will show the command line method as well. Additionally, saving via the GUI has one trick, so I will show you how to do this in pictures as well (For example: 4.2). Remember, there are some advantages and disadvantages to each file type so review the section on file formats (4.1) if you are uncertain about which format to use. 4.5.1 .pdb files File&gt;Save As&gt;PDB file, then pick your Obj(s) and click OK, then select your file name and destination and click OK. Figure 4.2: Saving a PDB file using the GUI You will note that the first menu in 4.2 where you select Obj(s) has a selection bar at the bottom which you can enter text. This is not the filename, this is for you to pick a Molecule name or atom numbers. The file name goes in the second menu. Sometimes there will be a asterisk before .pdb (*.pdb) in the Filename box. This is a placeholder which you replace with your filename. # Command then which Obj(s) have the source model, # then the file name in this case test.pdb and some arguments &gt;SavePDB 1,pdb\\test.pdb,Format=PDB,Transform=Yes It is possible to save several Objects or Molecules in the same PDB file, but you will likely need to Transfer them all to the same set of coordinates first. Transfer is found in the Edit menu. 4.5.2 .yob files Saving a .yob file is very similar to saving a pdb file, only without the issues of coordinates. File&gt;Save As&gt;YASARA YOb, then pick your Obj, file name, destination, and then click OK. Figure 4.3: Saving a file in .yob format using the GUI # Command then which Obj(s) have the source model, # then the file name in this case dhfrt.yob &gt;SaveYOb 1,yob\\dhfrt.yob A .yob can only contain one Object, if you need to save more than one object in a single file, use .pdb or .sce. 4.5.3 .sce files Saving a model as a .sce file is the simplest of all the file types as it save everything in the viewing window. File&gt;Save As&gt;YASARA Sce, then pick your file name and destination. # Command then the file name in this case dhfr_watertest.sce &gt;SaveSce sce\\dhfr_watertest.sce 4.6 Knowledge Self-Checks4 If you had colored a molecule and wanted to save the model and the stylizing of the model, which file types would be best?

We will cover how to Position and orient molecules manually and reproducibly (5.1) and then stylize the molecule using different representations (5.2), colors (5.3), and how to make surface representations (5.4). Chapter 7 will cover how to label (??) and change the color of your background (??), 5.1 Position and orienting the model I will focus on mouse and command line based commands. For keyboard based commands, I highly recommend watching the help movie on Working with YASARA found under Help&gt;Play Help Movie, then select 1.1. Working with YASARA. Models in YASARA can be manipulated in many ways. Setting how the model is arrayed in the window is among the simplest command, but often the most difficult setting to master. Table 5.1 shows the basic mouse commands used in YASARA. If you have a three-button mouse, YASARA is very straightforward to use. However, the differences in the Mac and Windows/Linux actions with a mouse can create some issues. Table 5.1: Table of Mouse-based commands in YASARA YASARA action Mouse Action Mac Track Pad Rotate model Left + move One-finger press and move Move in plane of screen Center + move Not available Zoom in or out Right + move Two-finger press and move Select Atom Left-click on an atom One finger click Select Atom and Bring up pop-up menu Left-click on an atom, then right-click One-finger click then Two-finger click 5.1.1 Making Reproducible Views How a molecule is alinged within the viewing window is dependent on two aspects Position and Orientation. Position is the coordinates of the Obj/Mol/Res/Atom within the viewing window. In YASARA, position is described by X, Y, and Z values which are given in Angstroms and can be both positive and negative. Orientation is the rotation of the molecule in the window defined by Alpha, Beta, and Gamma angles given in units of degrees. The orientation and position of a molecule can be found via the menus by: Effects&gt;Position&gt;Get for Obj, and then select the Obj and Effects&gt;Orientation&gt;Get for Obj, and then select the Obj For either action, the values are returned in the command line. I find it is easier to use the command line as there is a single command that gives both position and orientation. #Open the command line and load a test molecule from the RCSB &gt;LoadPDB 1UBQ, download=yes #Retrieve the Position and Orientation &gt;PosOriObj 1 #Response from YASARA PosOriObj 01, X=0.000, Y=0.000, Z=50.000, Alpha=0.000, Beta=0.000, Gamma=0.000 # You can do Pos and Ori commands separately as well &gt;PosObj 1 #Response from YASARA Obj 01: X=0.000, Y=0.000, Z=50.000 A &gt;OriObj 1 #Response from YASARA Obj 01: Alpha=0.000, Beta=0.000, Gamma=0.000 deg The PosOriObj command can also set the orientation so that you can always return to the same view. This seems useless until you need to make figures such as of mutated or altered models and you want the same view for easy comparison by your reader. A simple way to change the position is the call the PosOriObj command and then copy the result back into the command line which can now be edited. Once you make your changes, press enter and the model will move. One key point is that these positions and orientations are absolute based on the starting position of the molecule, they are not relative. So applying the same PosOriObj command repeatedly will produce the same orientation. The code chunk below shows a series of commands and Figure 5.1 shows how the molecule changes position. #Open the command line and load a test molecule from the RCSB &gt;LoadPDB 1UBQ, download=yes #Retrieve the Position and Orientation &gt;PosOriObj 1 #Initial position after loading PosOriObj 01, X=0.000, Y=0.000, Z=50.000, Alpha=0.000, Beta=0.000, Gamma=0.000 #Move the model 40 A closer by changing Z &gt;PosOriObj 01, X=0.000, Y=0.000, Z=10.000, Alpha=0.000, Beta=0.000, Gamma=0.000 #Rotate about the Gamma axis &gt;PosOriObj 01, X=0.000, Y=0.000, Z=50.000, Alpha=0.000, Beta=0.000, Gamma=90.000 # Move model 10 A up, 10 A closer, rotate 20 degrees around Beta # and 10 degrees around Gamma axis &gt;PosOriObj 01, X=0.000, Y=10.000, Z=40.000, Alpha=0.000, Beta=20.000, Gamma=10.000 Figure 5.1: Change in the view of the 1UBQ model using the PosOriObj commands Making note of good orientations and positions by using PosOriObj is a huge time saver and makes your figures look more professional. 5.2 Changing how the model looks Scientists have several ways of looking at molecules including biomolecules. These representations provide distinct levels of information. YASARA can show the same biomolecule in different ways as well. The commands are shown in Table 5.2 and Figure 5.2. Table 5.2 also provides information on what information is shown with each representation. Note that when it says F4, it means the F4 function key at the top of the keyboard. Macs and modern laptops often combine the function keys with other uses so you may have to push the Fn + F4 to get it to work. Also shown in both the table and Figure 5.2 is the command line.
