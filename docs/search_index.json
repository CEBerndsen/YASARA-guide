I wrote this for students in my class, however it developed into a guide for those who wanted to explore structures using freely available resources. 1.2 What is in this guide? This guide contains 3 main parts: 1. Guide to YASARA functions for users 2. Analysis and Illustration of molecular structure using YASARA 3. Incorporating YASARA into an educational setting 1.3 A note on using the command line GUIs are great, however it is worth knowing how to use the command line to increase speed and control. Yes, it is not as easy, especially for new users, but restricting your use to activities that are easy is a limited existence. I will always describe both ways of doing things in YASARA by menu list: Menu1&gt;menu2&gt;menu3&gt;choice and code chunk with comments: # This is a comment in code &gt; This is code that can be executed For R, it will be via code chunks and for Excel via menus. Other programs will be described as appropriate with images. 1.4 End of section checks and active reading I encourage you to actively read this book. Try to follow along descriptions in the program and recreate my results. Most sections in Parts 1 and 2 will end with a few tasks to complete to ensure that the reader understands the material. This is not required or graded, just an aid in learning to use the program. Answers are provided in the answers chapter along with explanations. 1.5 Questions and corrections I make mistakes. If you find an error or something does not make sense let me know via the GitHub page for this book. You can also maka pull request for corrections or helpful additions. 1.6 Acknowledgements 1.6.1 Who owns YASARA and the other programs in this book I have no claims to YASARA or any of the other programs described in this guide. Citations and links are provided where appropriate to give authors credit where due. I receive no compensation from any of the developers; I just enjoy using their software. I have written macros and R scripts that are referenced in this guide and I have made those freely available here under an MIT License. "],
["obtaining-yasara.html", "Chapter 2 Obtaining YASARA 2.1 What is YASARA 2.2 Download YASARAview 2.3 Installing YASARA", " Chapter 2 Obtaining YASARA 2.1 What is YASARA YASARA stands for Yet Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application and allows interactive viewing, manipulation, and analysis of molecular data and models. The simplest version of YASARA, YASARAview, is freely available via the internet at: http://www.yasara.org/viewdl.htm For a fee, more capable versions of YASARA are available. However, the majority of this book will deal with the functions in free version of YASARA, YASARAview. 2.2 Download YASARAview Visit the YASARAview website and enter the appropriate information into the menu. If you are unsure about 32-bit or 64-bit, in Windows this information is shown by clicking on This PC in the Windows Explorer then System Properties. System Type will indicate 32-bit or 64-bit as shown in 2.1 . Figure 2.1: The steps to find operating system for a Windows user Once you have submitted the information, you will receive an email which will let you download the YASARA program. 2.3 Installing YASARA Move the YASARA program (Mac) or install package (Windows) to an appropriate folder. I have found that installing and running YASARA from the Downloads folder is not a good idea. On Macs, it seems that programs in the Downloads folder are not given read/write permission which can cause issues with running YASARA. "],
["the-yasara-user-interface.html", "Chapter 3 The YASARA user interface 3.1 Heads Up Display (HUD) 3.2 The Console 3.3 Menu System 3.4 Where to find help 3.5 File system 3.6 Knowledge Self-Checks", " Chapter 3 The YASARA user interface Open YASARA and you should see a screen that looks similar to 3.1. Figure 3.1: The initial YASARA screen When a file is loaded it will appear in the center of the display in one of the various visualiation styles to be covered in a section ??. So far we have not learned to load a molecule or to select anything, so do not panic! This chapter is one to read to start and then read again after you have read through Chapters 4 to 7. The next sections will orient you to the Heads-up Display (3.1), the command line console 3.2, the top Menu 3.3, and the file organization (3.5), and includes a section on where to find help (3.4). 3.1 Heads Up Display (HUD) The Heads-up Display or HUD in YASARAview consists of two main pieces: the Atom Properties list and the Scene Content 3.2. Figure 3.2: Heads-Up Display in YASARA. The Atom properties area is shown inside the yellow box, while the Scene Content table is shown in the red box 3.1.1 Atom Properties The Atom Properties list describes the characteristics of a selected atom. These characteristics include the identifying traits such as element, what residue:Mol:Object it is a part of, and where it is located. Further characteristics place it within the context of the molecule being displayed under the section Bonds. Finally, there is a section containing 3 items: Marked Distance, Marked Angle, and Marked Dihedral. These are types of measurements we will use in Chapter ??. 3.1.2 Scene Content The Scene Content table shows what models1 are loaded into the system. There are 5 columns in this table: Obj, Name, Vis, Act, and Atom. Obj: Numerical assignment of the Obj. This is a useful indentifier for commands to maniupulate the Obj. Name: Indicates the name of the model. Typically this is the PDB ID, however you can rename the Object. Vis: Stands for “Visible”. When a file is loaded, this will default “Yes”. Left-clicking with the mouse on “Yes”, will change it to “No” and the model will disappear2. Act: Stands for “Active”. When a file is loaded, this will default to “Yes”. A file that is active can be manipulated and is included in the view screen if Vis is set to “Yes. To change this to”No&quot; the Object must be removed from the screen ??. Atom: This column shows the number of the first atom in the Object. Like Obj this number can be useful for manipulating the view and other commands. 3.1.3 Hiding the HUD The HUD can be hid or revealed by pressing the “Insert” key. This will be important when taking screenshots or making figures as covered in Chapter ??. 3.2 The Console You can manipulate the view and perform analysis of the molecules in YASARA through two methods: the Console and the Menu system (3.3). The console can be accessed by pressing the Space Bar. The console will appear at the bottom of the program window as shown in Figure 3.3. Pressing the Space Bar a second time will result in a larger console window. To hide the console, click your mouse in the program window somewhere outside of the console area. Figure 3.3: The console in YASARA, just another name for the command line. Left panel shows the small console window and the right panel shows the large console window Commands are typed directly into the console in the YASARA command system or Python. You can also copy and paste into the console using the Ctrl+C followed by Ctrl+V keys. Additionally you can copy console text by hightlighting and pressing Ctrl+C. The latter activity will be a useful tool when we get to the chapter on Making Movies (??). 3.2.1 Up Arrow! If you want to repeat or edit a command that you have already executed, whether in the console or using the interactive GUI or the menus, pressing Space Bar followed by the Up Arrow copies the previous command and allows you to repeat or edit the command to tweak the outcome. In YASARAview this is limited to the previous ten commands so if you know you are going to use a complex command again, copy it out before it is lost! 3.2.2 Tangent on using the command line and the interactive menus Users who are new to YASARA are often hesitant to use the console to perform tasks. For my students, they report this is due to inexperience with non-GUI interfaces and a fear of not knowing what to do. I get it. It took me nearly 3 years of using YASARA before I became comfortable even opening the console regularly and even today, I still struggle to get the command line to work and to find the correct commands. BUT knowing how the program makes changes to the contents of the window is valuable for understanding what happened if it is not readily apparent and if you need help, having a sense of the command that is causing problems will make finding aid easier. As you become more experienced, you might begin to find command line is more versatile and even faster (assuming you type efficiently). For beginners, start by using the menus and checking the console for the command. Then start using the console to refine choices after using the menus to make the command. Finally, as you feel confident do as much as you can using the console. 3.3 Menu System In addition to the console, YASARA can be controlled using the Menu System which has three parts: the Top Menu, the Top Row Buttons, and the Pop-up Menus. 3.3.1 Top Menu The Top Menu will look familiar to users who use the Microsoft suite of programs or most modern productivity software. The 8 top-level categories are shown in the green box in Figure 3.4. We will explore several of this categories in more depth in later chapters. One note to make now is that the Analyze category is inaccessible until a molecule is loaded. This is shown as being in light grey, compared to the black of other categories. In general, if a menu category or option cannot be used under the current conditions, it will be colored grey. Figure 3.4: Menu Bar of YASARA showing the Top Menu inside the green box and the Top row buttons inside the light blue box 3.3.2 Top row buttons The Top row buttons are quick ways to perform tasks such as center the view or open a new scene. The buttons are indicated by the light blue box in Figure 3.4. The buttons will vary depending what version of YASARA being used however there are a few common and useful ones, which are highlighted below. : This button allows you to select parts of a model in a box : This button allows you to select parts of a model in an arbitrary area which is somewhat circular. This is similar to the lasso tool seen in other programs. : This button clears everything out of the YASARA window. Typically you will get a warning to avoid inadvertant loss of data. : This button centers the active models in the window. This really useful early on until you gain experience orienting molecules. : This button rotates all the active models in the window. This button is often a source of frustrating for you when things start rotating unexpectedly. 3.3.3 Pop-up menu Figure 3.5: Example of the pop-up menu in YASARA In addition to the visible command options and readouts of YASARA like the Top Menu (3.3) and the HUD (3.1), there are ways to access commands on a selection. Referred to here as the pop-up menu (??), this menu can be accessed after a selection has been made by clicking on the selection using the right mouse button. Many of the options in the pop-up menu are found with some digging through the top menu, so this pop-up menu is a fast, easy way to find some of the most used commands. The pop-up menu is only accessible with a model loaded into YASARA. 3.4 Where to find help HELP!!!! This is probably the most requested piece of information. The reason for putting this underneath all the orientation is to make getting help easier. YASARA has a specific set of words and phrases. Knowing the “jargon” of YASARA makes limiting the amount of information during a help request easier. 3.4.1 SearchDoc The SearchDoc function can be found two ways: Help&gt;Search User Manual3 OR Press the Space Bar to open the console and type SearchDoc followed by the inquiry word or command. See code chunk below for examples. # Search for every help page containing the word color &gt;SearchDoc color # Search for every help page referencing the word PDB &gt;SearchDoc PDB The help page will open as a webpage in your default web browser (3.6). This page will list every time that word or phrase appears in the YASARA documentation. Figure 3.6: Results of using SearchDoc part 1: Initial search results Clicking on any of the blue links will take you to the page for the command as shown in 3.7. These pages have 3 parts: The box showing information on the command A brief text description of the command and purpose Examples of how to use the command in the console or in a macro. Figure 3.7: Results of using SearchDoc part 2: The help page for the ColorBG command Like this reference, the Menu row in the box describes where in the Menus this command is found. This is most useful early on and as you learn more about YASARA, the examples become useful too. Often you can compare what happened in your console to the examples to make sure that you are looking at the right command and using the correct arguments. 3.4.2 Help Movies While not formally part of the help system, users can click on the Help category in the top menu and then choose Play Help Movie (Help&gt;Play Help Movie) to access YASARA rendered movies introducing users to a variety of topics. The movies are interactive and useful for first-time users, however they are not searchable and can take a while to find a specific topic. Therefore, I recommend going through the help movies once or twice early on, but using SearchDoc as you become more experienced. 3.5 File system 3.6 Knowledge Self-Checks When I say Model I am referring to a file that is loaded in YASARA that displays as a molecule. The main file types that do this are .pdb, .sce, and .yob and will be covered more extensively in the next chapter↩ While the model will disappear any commands that you execute will apply the model!↩ Remember that menu commands will be designated as Menu Category&gt;Sub-option&gt;Sub-sub-option&gt;…↩ "],
